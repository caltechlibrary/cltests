Introduction
------------

This is avery minimal lightweight test library. It provides one classes
for managing a test set. The second object T provides a set of methods
maintaining test result state that can be returned by your test function.
It will also and a set of assertions that using the form
of expected value, test result value,  message and current test state.
The expected function return a new test state if the test fails.

- TestSet is a class for managing, running and reporting your tests.
- T tests for expected type and value and reports failures.
    - ExpectedBool
    - ExpectedStr
    - ExpectedInt (etc)
    - Fail


Exmaple:

~~~
    import sys

    from cltests import TestSet, T

    def mytest():
        t = T()
        t.ExpectedBool(True, False, "True # False", test)       
        return t.Results()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        ts = TestSet("My test demo")
        ts.add(mytest)
        if ts.run():
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            sys.exit(1)
~~~

Installation
